Hello LangGraph!
This is a test file for our C-based file statistics tool.
It has multiple lines and various words.

The tool will count:
- Lines (like this one)
- Words in each line
- Total characters including spaces and newlines
- File size in bytes

This demonstrates how C programs can integrate with AI agents
through LangGraph's tool system for efficient file processing.
